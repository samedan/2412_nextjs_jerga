### changes

1. Important changes with <Image>

If you see some errors related to <Image> component

change the import of the Image this way:

import Image from 'next/legacy/image'

instead of

import Image from "next/image"

Then it should work the same as in the lectures.

2. Important changes with <Link>

If you see this error:

Error: Invalid <Link> with <a> child. Please remove <a> or use <Link legacyBehavior>. Learn more: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/invalid-new-link-with-extra-anchor

The fix is very simple. Find in the layout <Link> component, for example, this one:

    <Link href="/">
      <a className="navbar-item">
         <h1>Content Manager</h1>
      </a>
    </Link>

1. And change it to:

<Link href="/" className="navbar-item">
   <h1>Content Manager</h1>
</Link>

2. OR keep it as it was, and add to it legacyBehavior prop, so it looks like this:

<Link legacyBehavior href="/"> 
  <a className="navbar-item"> 
     <h1>Content Manager</h1> 
  </a> 
</Link>

Very simple. You need to do this with all links. This is the easiest way to fix it and not break the layout.
